## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### **Issue:**
The admin panel login page was missing the beautiful **MenuPick logo** that the student app has. It only showed plain text "Admin Panel" which looked unprofessional.

### **Solution:**
I've updated the admin panel login page to match the student app's design:

1. ✅ **Added Logo Component** - Now displays the beautiful shield+cloche logo
2. ✅ **Removed Redundant Header** - Cleaner, more focused design
3. ✅ **Updated Logo Subtitle** - Changed from "Campus Dining" to "Admin Portal"
4. ✅ **Cleaned Up Code** - Removed unused imports and components

## 🎨 Changes Made

### **Files Modified:**

1. **`f:\MenuPick\meal-admin-panel\src\components\Logo.jsx`**
   - Changed subtitle from "Campus Dining" to "Admin Portal"

2. **`f:\MenuPick\meal-admin-panel\src\pages\Login.jsx`**
   - Added Logo component import
   - Replaced icon-only logo with full Logo component
   - Removed redundant header section
